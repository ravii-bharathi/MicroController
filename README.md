# MicroController

A collection of embedded firmware projects and hardware experiments built for STM32F407VET and ESP32-DevKit boards. This repository explores practical embedded systems development â€” from peripheral interfacing to communication protocols and real-world embedded applications.  Each project demonstrates structured firmware design, modular code organization, and cross-platform portability between ARM and Xtensa architectures. Examples include driver-level coding for GPIO, UART, I2C, and SPI; multitasking systems using FreeRTOS; and integration between STM32 and ESP32 for data communication and OTA workflows.  Highlights Projects written in C/C++ using STM32CubeIDE, ESP-IDF, and PlatformIO.  Unified repository structure for scalable multi-board firmware development.  Contains reusable common drivers, board-specific ports, and utility scripts.  Educational-ready examples suitable for learning firmware design and testing methodologies.  Emphasis on bare-metal programming, RTOS concepts, and embedded communication protocols.  Topics embedded-systems stm32f4 esp32 firmware-development freertos iot microcontrollers embedded-c
